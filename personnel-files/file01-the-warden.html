        <h2 class="file-report">Personnel File Report</h2>
        <p>In light of the Personnel Database being impartial, this file is being written by an Officer and not the Warden themselves. It will be fact checked and reviewed by a council before publishing.</p>

        <p><strong>File Number</strong>: File 01</p>

        <p><strong>Personnel Name</strong>: Nero Themis</p>

        <p><strong>Species</strong>: Neo-Lagomorph Rexis (Neo-Lagos)</p>

        <p><strong>Position/Title</strong>: The Warden</p>

        <p><strong>Clearance Level</strong>: Total</p>

        <p><strong>Summary</strong>: Most often referred to as the Warden, Nero Themis is a Neo-Lagos who alongside several other anomalies from the source dimension Lummus have found themselves stuck in the secondary dimension now called Terra. Although stuck here due to a cataclysmic event that destroyed their original dimension, they are still behind the most prepared and deadly force humanity has ever faced, having tremendous amounts of experience and data in regards to anomalous entities and artifacts.</p>

        <p>Nero described Lummus as the "original dimension" from which all others originate, being the oldest, most complex, and most populated across all dimensions. Our dimension, called Terra, merged with Lummus due to an anomaly known as "Vorath the Veiled."</p>

        <p>The strange spaceship known as "The Ward" appeared in earth's atmosphere on June 5, 2254. During a meeting between General Francis, a superior officer of the World Government and the Warden themselves, it was explained that this strange spaceship is an <strong>ISO</strong> (Interdimensional Space-Obeliskron), capable of distorting and reconfiguring the laws of physics to a limited extent. It serves as the main base of operations for the Ward's personnel and as a prison or vault for anomalies that are now scattered throughout our own dimension.</p>

        <p>The World Government is aware of the Warden's intentions to serve as a protector, however it remains skeptical given the threat their presence poses to their hegemony.</p>

        <p><strong>Service Record</strong>: Having created the Ward, Nero is considered an extremely capable engineer and leader, having an astonishing intuition and a vast amount of knowledge in regards to dealing with these anomalies. They have mentioned before that the battle against anomalies started long before the cataclysm that destroyed their original dimension.</p>

        <p>Most of the anomalies currently under containment were directly captured or recovered by the Warden themselves, they have also aided the World Government in recovery efforts following natural disasters or attacks from rogue anomalies.</p>

        <p><strong>Specialization/Skills</strong>: The extent of the Warden’s abilities is unknown; however, they have been observed exercising supernatural control over the elements, energy, and in some cases, matter, space, and even time itself. During a meeting with the world government of Terra, they mentioned being capable of temporarily stopping time, reverting time by a few seconds, and halting time for specific individuals. They have also noted that their ability to control time is currently severely hindered because many of the anomalous entities contained within the Ward require complete temporal stasis for successful containment.</p>

        <p><strong>Appearance</strong>: Nero's true appearance was that of an anthropomorphic lagomorph, but instead of fur, they had scales reminiscent of a shark. They possessed long, heavy ears, feline paws, and powerful muscular legs. This form was shorter in stature compared to their initial form. Strikingly, they also had what appeared to be gills, despite having a nose, and featured a scorpion-like tail and horns akin to those of a jackalope.</p>

        <p><strong>Psychological Evaluation</strong>: The Warden is pragmatic, and although calm, they have been angered by humans in the past through sheer incompetence or needless cruelty. Quiet and collected, very few have had the opportunity to witness genuine signs of emotions from them as they prefer expressing them through words rather than through their face or body. On rare occasions, the Warden has been seen irritated; although they did not express their emotions overtly, the very air in the room seemed to tremble with their anger.</p>

        <p><strong>Notable Incidents</strong>: Non-Applicable.</p>

        <p><strong>Current Assignment</strong>: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operation Wise, a mission pursuing the expansion of the Ward.</li>
            <li>Operation Castelo Breach, a mission of research and pursuit of high threat level entities and artifacts.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Status</strong>: Active</p>

        <p><span style="color: #e7b11f;""><strong>Exceptional Addendum</strong></span>: Commonly referred to as Neo-Lagos, the Garanus, were a race of powerful anthropomorphic bunnies who inhabited Neo-Morphalis A, a highly advanced planet from the original dimension Lummus.</p>

        <p>They were the physically dominant species in the planet, being considered by their partnered species the Sekhat as the "Apex Predatorial Species" from Neo-Morphalis A. Instead of fur, their skin was coated in scales reminiscent of those from a shark, however strong enough to easily deflect or absorb the damage from an experimental railgun during an attempted assassination, which was estimated to have delivered 720,000 joules of kinetic energy.</p>

        <p><strong>Anatomical Traits</strong>:</p>

        <p>Their long ears, although varying in range and weight, most often cannot stand upright. However, they are always capable of wrapping around their heads, preferring to do so as a measure against accidentally opening their eyes and absorbing bright visuals from the magnetic or energy fields surrounding them, which can be somewhat uncomfortable.</p>

        <p>Each of their paws contains four digits and resembles those of felines, bearing powerful sharp claws that can cut through steel like a hot utensil through butter. Older Neo-Lagos can temporarily manipulate the number of digits they possess, often using this ability to interact with their technological infrastructure.</p>

        <p>Their powerful, muscular legs are so dense and heavy that for a long time, the Neo-Lagos lacked the technology to properly scan them for injuries or tumors. This was not a problem, however, as their legs possess the most advanced registered healing factor outside of anomalous entities.</p>

        <p>The respiratory system of the Neo-Lagos is considered quite advanced; they can breathe both underwater and on land, having gills as well as a nose. It is theorized that this adaptation was necessary due to the constant floods their region endured during their evolution.</p>

        <p>Although most members of the Neo-Lagos appear to have no horns, all possess them and simply keep them hidden, as it is considered extremely rude in their culture to display them—akin to baring one's fists for no apparent reason. These horns resemble those of jackalopes and are used to discharge high amounts of energy as well as manipulate matter to a certain extent.</p>

        <p>Their eyes are special, capable of perceiving energy and magnetic fields, and are under the complete control of the individual Neo-Lagos, except while they are sleeping.</p>

        <p>Their tails are heavily specialized, producing microscopic spikes when grabbed or touched. When the Garanus is agitated, these spikes cause immediate pain and itching, leading to confusion in most prey as they are slowly paralyzed by botulinum toxin.</p>

        <p>The Neo-Lagos can also secrete their toxin and cover their tail's microspikes, so that when released, a cloud of them can slow down larger prey or even kill it outright.</p>

        <p>The stinger in their tails is capable of injecting a symbiotic virus that behaves similarly to the Marburg virus from Earth. However, as it has evolved with the Neo-Lagos, it has become a faster, stronger, and more powerful virus than anything known to humans.</p>

        <p>Early symptoms usually include fever, chills, severe headaches, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, rashes all over the body, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, red eyes, loss of appetite, and fatigue.</p>

        <p>Within a few hours, the condition worsens, causing bleeding in several parts of the body, such as the nose, gums, and throat, along with various neurological symptoms like seizures or even coma.</p>

        <p>As simultaneous hermaphrodites, the Neo-Lagos have the ability to modify their own reproductive organs to meet their needs. While this transformation takes several months, it is typically a smooth process that can be repeated continuously throughout their lives.</p>

        <p><strong>Societal Structure</strong>: The Garanian society was divided into three main social classes: the workers class (Zerv), the servants class (Zugali), and the ruling class (Lum).</p>

        <p>The workers were responsible for overseeing maintenance, production, and economics.</p>

        <p>The servants were responsible for managing technology, services, and the transport of goods.</p>

        <p>The ruling class was responsible for budgeting, protective warfare, and law enforcement.</p>

        <p>Among all of these classes, a select group known as the Judges (Themis) was considered the highest authority in their society, responsible for diplomatic endeavors, offensive warfare, and the investigation of anomalies occurring across their world.</p>

        <p>Each class had a few members chosen to be part of this select group. From the workers class, Nero Themis was eventually brought into the ruling class and gained enough popularity to be elected as a Themis himself.</p>
