        <p><strong>Log Entry</strong>: 01</p>

        <p><strong>Date:</strong> April 7th, 2246</p>

        <p><strong>Event:</strong> Cataclysmic Dimensional Convergence - “The Outbreak”</p>

        <p><strong>Overview</strong>:<br>
        On April 7th, 2246, a catastrophic dimensional convergence occurred, marking the most devastating and destructive incident in recorded history. This event, later named "The Outbreak," drastically reshaped human society, as well as the planet's geology and ecosystem.</p>

        <p><strong>Details of the Event:</strong><br>
        At 05:23 UTC, electronic devices all across the world showed signs of interference as seismic activity and thunderstorms intensified globally. An unprecedented power surge damaged numerous devices and infrastructures, causing mass panic. Within two hours, multiple anomalous entities appeared en masse in large cities, attacking civilians and buildings alike. The military responded swiftly, but significant damage had already been done, and many cities were left largely destroyed. Humanity managed to fight back and protect itself, but the world was about to change drastically.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Affected Areas:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pacific Rim</strong>: Major coastal cities in Asia, North America, and South America faced violent hordes of anomalies coming from the sea. Tokyo, San Francisco, and Rio de Janeiro were among the hardest hit, with the total collapse of infrastructure in many regions.</li>
            <li><strong>Atmospheric Impact</strong>: The dimensional convergence caused natural phenomena such as storms, earthquakes, and tornadoes to worsen for a period of time, leading to even more damage, while several anomalous entities took to the skies.</li>
            <li><strong>Human and Environmental Toll</strong>: An estimated 1.8 billion lives were lost due to the combined effects of the dimensional convergence, seismic activity, flooding, and the subsequent famine triggered by crop failure and supply chain disruptions. Many water sources were contaminated, leading to mass extinction events in several species of freshwater fish.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Response or Recovery Efforts:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Global Coordination</strong>: Emergency efforts were hampered by communication blackouts and the loss of satellite networks. However, surviving governments formed the <strong>Global Reconstruction Pact (GRP)</strong>, aimed at organizing relief, restoring infrastructure, and establishing sustainable food production in unaffected regions. This effort would later pave the way for the establishment of the <strong>World Government (WG)</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Societal Adaptation</strong>: Several scientific bodies proposed the development of defense forces specifically trained to deal with the anomalous entities that had now become a part of daily life across the planet. However, research efforts were slow, with many predicting it would take decades before the planet could stabilize and effectively combat the anomalies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Current Status:</strong><br>
        The Outbreak left humankind and planet Earth in a fragile state. Nations now live under strict rationing, and widespread displacement has led to a new era of global migration. Scientists continue to monitor the anomalies, hoping to spearhead a breakthrough in the development of defensive measures against them.</p>

        <p>On June 5th, 2254, the World Government military forces were put on high alert due to a potential threat emerging in Earth’s orbit. This would be the first time humanity had any contact with <strong>The Ward</strong>.</p>
