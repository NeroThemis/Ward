        <p>This form has been filled in accordance with the Informative Template entry, and has been peer-reviewed by a scribe agent and approved by a superior officer.</p>

        <p><strong>Subject</strong>: The Cogbound Blight</p>

        <p><strong>Entry</strong>: 142</p>

        <p><strong>Instance</strong>: Individual</p>

        <p><strong>Threat Level</strong>: Mass</p>

        <p><strong>Status</strong>: Elusive</p>

        <p><strong>Summary</strong>: During the outbreak, New Valencia in Canada was affected by an anomalous event that turned many of its citizens into mutated humans capable of manipulating technology to varying extents. Jeremiah Smith, theorized to be the most violently and extensively affected by the event, is believed to have become a type of anomaly called "Cogbound Blight," presumably the only one that was able to develop after the dimensional convergence.</p>

        <p>A Cogbound Blight is a type of organ developed by the Clockwork that devoured entire worlds in Lummus. The Clockwork was severely affected during the outbreak, leading to nearly all of its core organs being simply erased from existence. In a last attempt to develop new roots, the anomaly released a powerful wave of energy and "seeds," many of which were successfully destroyed by Earth's atmosphere. Two, however, landed in the surroundings of New Valencia: one in the environment and the other directly on someone. Of all the victims, the only one that wasn't found or confirmed dead was Jeremiah Smith, who seemingly has turned into what the Warden referred to as a Cogbound Blight, an elusive factory that mass-produces violent robots.</p>
