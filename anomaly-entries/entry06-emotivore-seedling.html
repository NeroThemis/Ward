        <h2 class="file-report">Entry 06 - Affectus</h2>
        <p>This form has been filled in accordance with the Informative Template entry, and has been peer-reviewed by a scribe agent and approved by a superior officer.</p>

        <p><strong>Subject</strong>: Emotivore Seedling</p>
        
        <p><strong>Entry</strong>: 06</p>
        
        <p><strong>Instance</strong>: Species</p>
        
        <p><strong>Threat Level</strong>: Mass</p>
        
        <p><strong>Status</strong>: Not Applicable</p>
        
        <p><strong>Summary</strong>: Spontaneously born through the accumulation of specific emotions, they range from completely harmless to terrifyingly dangerous. The Affectus are an anomaly that absorbs sentient beings' emotions and uses them as fuel to develop their own bodies. What defines whether they are dangerous or not is not the emotions they gather, but their own whims.</p>
        
        <p>When an Affectus establishes a territory, it will gestate like any other baby, its cells dividing and randomly shaping an organism very similarly to how our own evolutionary needs shaped us. They are innately capable of surviving in any natural conditions in their environment, hunting everything from bacteria to insects and even large prey like elk and deer.</p>
        
        <p>When their first urges to violence begin, they will start burrowing nearby dens or houses, feasting on any emotions they can findâ€”positive or negative, as they all have certain preferences.</p>
        
        <p>After a while, they will use this energy to influence their environment, creating an open realm of illusions and traps that manifest creatures called Pathos. These creatures will often leave these realms under the orders of the Affectus, hunting live prey to be used as food and fuel.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Containment Procedure</strong>: Although completely containing or eliminating the Affectus has been deemed impossible, measures to mitigate the threat they represent have been implemented. Regular monitoring and intervention by the World Government and Ward have been successful in spreading awareness, educating civilians, and developing the necessary tools to report their presence in the area.</p>
        
        <p>The Affectus drain their victims' emotions, leading them to feel slightly numb or out of touch. These effects can be measured against a level of normalcy, and if determined to be an anomalous circumstance, the surrounding area will receive special forces trained specifically to deal with the Affectus and the Pathos created by them.</p>
