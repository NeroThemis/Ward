        <h2 class="file-report">Entry 05 - Orbearer</h2>
        <p>This form has been filled in accordance with the Informative Template entry, and has been peer-reviewed by a scribe agent and approved by a superior officer.</p>
        <p><strong>Subject</strong>: Haze Vulture</p>

        <p><strong>Entry</strong>: 05</p>
        
        <p><strong>Instance</strong>: Collective</p>
        
        <p><strong>Threat Level</strong>: Group</p>
        
        <p><strong>Status</strong>: Partially Contained</p>
        
        <p><strong>Summary</strong>: Inhabiting forests across South and North America, the Orbearer is a highly dangerous anomalous entity that uses its environment and powers to confuse its prey, eventually leading them to its nest, where it will attack and feed on them. It is often seen carrying a small orb of light, a weapon capable of focusing the anomaly's energy into a devastating beam.</p>
        
        <p>They are solitary creatures, very rarely seen with another of their species; however, groups referred to as pacts by the population have been reported to the world government, with sizes ranging from 50 to 140 members. Efforts to locate these pacts have been made, but they are always capable of escaping and establishing a new home elsewhere.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Containment Procedures</strong>: The Haze Vultures aren't difficult to track; however, their numbers pose a challenge in ensuring they are fully contained. During containment procedures, a mix of sound and visual lures is often the first strategy employed by the Ward's personnel. However, depending on the size of their pacts, these methods may not work if an experienced member of their group recognizes the patterns. In such cases, captured Haze Vultures may be used instead, earning their trust and slowly harvesting data on their precise numbers and environment.</p>
        
        <p>These captured Haze Vultures will often have had their memories of a previous capture wiped, making them perfect spies. The data collected will then be used to plan a full-scale assault on their territory, often involving several groups and strategies to prevent the potential escape of any anomalies.</p>
