        <h2 class="file-report">Profile 07 - Tobias 'True Shot' Chrome</h2>
        <p><strong>Profile Number</strong>: 07</p>

        <p><strong>Name</strong>: Tobias Chrome</p>

        <p><strong>Aliases</strong>: True Shot, Tobey and Chrom</p>

        <p><strong>Species</strong>: Human</p>

        <p><strong>Operational Conduct</strong>: Rogue Neutralizer</p>

        <p><strong>Summary</strong>:<br>
        Tobias Chrome is a member of the Order of the Watcher and is considered by the Disciple, the cult's leader, to be a "believer" who has "awakened." He is capable of manifesting small flames through his fingers and has occasionally been seen lighting leaves, pieces of paper, and various random objects. He is known to be an extremely valuable asset during conflicts against the world governmentâ€™s military forces and anomalies.</p>

        <p><strong>Known Interferences</strong>:<br>
        Tobias is known for having completely neutralized Entry 32, the Howl Hound, thereby preventing further studies and assessment of the properties of the anomalous entity.</p>

        <p><strong>Specialization/Skills</strong>: Marksman, remarkable proficiency in the use of precision rifles.</p>

        <p><strong>Psychological Evaluation</strong>:<br>
        A cunning man, he is very well-prepared to deal with any danger and has become jaded to many of the horrors posed by the anomalous entities that plague the world. While he does not particularly believe in the Warden as a god, he does have faith in the Warden as a protector of Terra.</p>

        <p><strong>Commentary</strong>:<br>
        Tobias Chrome is a fascinating individual. His contributions to the Ward have been both positive and negative. For now, the Warden has instructed us to keep him under vigilance. This section has been written by Honemi, under direct orders from the Warden.</p>

        <p><strong>Notable Incidents</strong>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>During the recovery of Entry 35, the Cumulus Glass, the Warden and Tobias exchanged some words in regards to the cult's position to the Warden themselves.<br>
            <blockquote>
                <p>"So, you are our god?" - Tobias</p>
                <p>"Foolish. I am no god, child of man." - The Warden</p>
                <p>"What are you then?" - Tobias</p>
                <p>"Alone. The only of my kind, fighting your wars." - The Warden</p>

            After this interaction, the Warden conducted the containment procedures for Entry 35 themselves, thanking the Order for their assistance.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Status</strong>: Alive</p>
